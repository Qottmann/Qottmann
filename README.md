I am interested in simulating quantum many body systems in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.  
Working on [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) - the definitive open-source Python framework for quantum programming. Built by researchers, for research.

Highlighted [blog posts and demos](https://pennylane.ai/search?q=kottmann&contentType=DEMO):
 * [Introducing (Dynamical) Lie Algebras for quantum practitioners](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_liealgebra)
 * [What is the time-ordered exponential and why you should stop using it](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2024/09/time_ordered_exponential)
   A rant on the fact that the notation of the time-ordered exponential implies that it is a function Texp(∙) with an integral as its argument inside.
 * [Shadow Hamiltonian simulation](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_shadow_hamiltonian_simulation)  
   Not to be confused with classical shadows, has nothing to do with it. Think of it as [g-sim](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_liesim) but on a quantum computer.
 * [Learning shallow quantum circuits with local inversions and circuit sewing](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_learningshallow/)  
   Shocasing circuit sewing with local inversions that have been introduced in introduced [2401.10095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10095).
 * [Evaluating analytic gradients of pulse programs on quantum computers](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_odegen/)  
   TLDR of our paper [2309.16756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16756) on a new method to evaluate gradients of quantum pulse programs on quantum hardware.
 * [Is quantum computing useful before fault tolerance?](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_mitigation_advantage)  
   Reproducing the key ingredients of the zero noise extraplation in IBM's paper on utility of quantum computing [Nature 618, 500–505, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3) and a comment on the comparison with classical methods.
 * [Pulse programming on OQC Lucy in PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/oqc_pulse/)  
   You can now run pulse programs on OQC's Lucy quantum computer in PennyLane via AWS Braket. Also discussing some basic physics of driving transmon qubits.
 * [Estimating observables with classical shadows in the Pauli basis](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_diffable_shadows.html)  
   Unraveling some of mysteries about classical shadows.
